# Encapsulation---Bank-Account-System
This project serves as a practical exercise to enhance my skills and deepen my understanding of encapsulation in programming. It is designed to simulate a secure banking system, allowing users to create accounts, log in, remove or delete accounts, and edit personal information. Additionally, it supports deposit and withdrawal transactions while implementing robust security authentication measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.

- Check account balance
- Error Handling & Data Validation

4. Ensures account numbers exist before login
- Prevents infinite loops in login attempts
- Validates input fields (account number, PIN, deposits, withdrawals)
- Encapsulation & Code Structure

5. Uses encapsulation principles for better data protection
